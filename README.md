The usage of GLH package is to allow users to use simple and multiple linear regression, predict the value and conduct the general linear hypothesis simultaneously. In this package, we export the output, including the estimated coefficients, confident intervals, p values, R square values, the predicted values with errors, F statistics and its p-value, etc. Compared to the base lm function and the well-established "car" package, our package is more efficient and memory-saving when running the same tasks. Since some arguments should be manually prepared before being passed into functions, some basic statistical knowledge is needed if the users want to fully use this package. But we provide the tutorial and description to help users better access and understand the functionalities of these methods.

Installation
